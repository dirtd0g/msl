<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.Introduction</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1 Dynasty League</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This league is a dynasty league, meaning that Owners draft players to fill out their rosters at the inception of the league. Owners can perform transactions – player pick-ups, trades and draft Rookies and other un-owned players – in order to build their team. This is a league that runs year around and is geared towards serious fantasy players.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.2 Commissioner</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner – Andy Szaniawski</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commish is in charge of making sure that all league actions are carried out and that the league runs smoothly. In case of a dispute, the commissioner’s ruling is final.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. League Structure and Requirements</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.1 Teams and Divisions</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be 12 teams in the league. There are no divisions but rather a ranking of teams based on record. Each season, structure will remain the same unless a change is deemed necessary by the Commish.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each team will be comprised of players in the NFL (i.e. no college players). Teams will compete in head-to-head competitions each week whereby the winner is the team whose starting lineup scores more points than the starting lineup of their opponent. Player points are determined by the scoring system detailed on the web site.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 Fantasy Week</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A "week" in fantasy football is from Tuesday through the end of the Monday night game. So Week 2 would be from the Tuesday following the Monday night game in week 1 through the Monday night game for week 2.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.3 New Owners</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an Owner leaves the league, a new Owner will be selected and will take over the team as is at that time, including rosters, draft picks, etc. All finances of the team will remain (thus no refunds to any Owner leaving early). The Commish will be responsible for finding replacement Owners. An Owner may not sell or otherwise change the Ownership of his/her team without Commish approval. If an Owner wishes to leave, the team becomes property of the league and the Commish will find a new Owner.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.4 Internet Access</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Owners are required to have Internet access. All reports are published on the league web site and all league announcements are made via email or on the home page. Starting lineups and trades must be done electronically on the web site for example. However should you not have Internet access the Commish should be contacted.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.5 Rule Changes</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year prior to the start of the season the commissioner will release the current items as proposed by owners to have a league vote for ratification.  In order for a rule to be passed and ratified the vote in favor of the rule change MUST have a majority of the owners, who have exercised their right to vote during the voting period, to pass and be ratified as a rule change. This is considered a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple Majority</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model for voting and ratifying new league rule changes.  Are rule change will not pass without </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple Majority</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ties will be treated as a failed vote and the rule change will not be ratified. Nonparticipation in the voting process will be considered "Yes" votes.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-season - There will be no in-season rule changes unless deemed necessary by the Commish.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.League Fees and Payouts</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.1 Owner Costs (*</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016)</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franchise Fee (per team) due by the kick-off of the first game of the season: $103*.  If league fees are not paid by an owner by week 3 of the regular season the Commish holds the right to address the issue of non-payment by an owner and will seek swift resolution so that league payouts are not compromised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*An Owner vote is required to raise the franchise fee from year to year.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All monies collected by the league will go into the "pot". Any league costs and prizes come out of the pot and 100% of all money is paid out each year. $3/team each season will be allocated to transfer of championship trophy and additional plaques for yearly champion. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.2 League Costs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">League fee = $74*, after early-bird discount; must be paid before July 1st. The Commish will always have this paid early to take advantage of the early-bird discount. *League fee is up to MFL and subject to change.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Championship trophy: $3/team each season will be allocated to transfer of championship trophy and additional plaques for yearly champion. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.3 Payouts Breakdown (2014, 2016)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">League Champion / 1st Place(45%): $506.70</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runner-Up / 2nd Place(25%): $281.50</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd Place(10%): $112.60</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly High Points(20%):$232.40</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* All payout money is taken from the pot after league costs have been paid.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining money in the pot will be used to pay out the Weekly Points Leaders each week (for the full 16 weeks). Each week, the Owner who scores the most points that week will earn $14.08(*2014 - $9.48). The Commish will keep a tally of the weekly winners and make the appropriate payouts at the end of the season.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payouts will be made at the conclusion of the season.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.Rosters and Lineups</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.1 Active Roster</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IR is not counted toward roster min/max. A maximum of 1 IR slots are available to each owner.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">23 players are on team’s active rosters and at no time can the roster maximum be breached during the season (only exception is for trades that cause unbalanced rosters).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Off-season: During the off-season rosters will expand to 34.  This is to accommodate the rookie draft and preseason roster moves prior to the kick-off off the next NFL season.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only positional minimums are whatever you need to field a starting lineup that week.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.2 Taxi Squad</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Taxi Squad” is a place to store a maximum of 4 players that do not count against your active roster total for any given season. There will be 4 spots open for Taxi Squad players.  Up to 4 players may be placed on the Taxi Squad  at the beginning of the season (by the roster cut-down date).  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These players will be “frozen” on your roster.  At no time can they be dropped, activated, traded, waived, or otherwise removed from your roster during a season. These players can be any skill position (QB,WR,RB,TE) and they are not required to be a rookie to qualify.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.2(a) - During the 2014 offseason the owners voted in an amendment to the taxi squad rules.  During the season each team (owner) is allowed to promote one (1) player from their taxi squad to their active roster assuming that they have the available roster space to make the move. This does not allow for moving someone from the active roster to the taxi squad to replace that empty taxi squad roster spot. This change must be completed by the kickoff of the first game of week 8 games.  In order to promote someone from the taxi squad to the active roster you MUST contact the commissioner to make the change.  This allows for transparency of all taxi squad changes to all owners/teams.  The commissioner will post each change so that all league owners can see taxi squad roster moves that have been made by all owners/teams.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Off-season: There will be no Taxi Squad in the off-season. By the end of the NFL regular season, all players can (and should) be removed from the Taxi Squad. This can include dropping them, or place them on your roster (within roster limits of course).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.3 Players and Positions</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each player on a team's roster must be considered a Quarterback (QB), Running back (RB), Wide Receiver (WR), Tight End (TE), Kicker (K), or Team Defense/Special Teams (Def).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final say on a player's position will be determined by the Commissioner and the player’s team web site and nfl.com will be consulted. Accordingly, if a player's position is potentially in question, an Owner should request a decision from the Commissioner regarding the player's position prior to adding the player to their roster.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Player A is a QB. He starts a game at WR. You CANNOT start him as a WR because his position is QB, however, if you start him at QB, you will receive whatever points he gets at WR.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.4 Injured Reserve</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the draft, any team may place a player on IR only if the player is on the official NFL IR report published on the league site. The players must be listed as INJURED RESERVE. Any other status is not acceptable. Once deactivated, the Owner must wait 1 day before placing the player back on the active roster.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must wait until the first IR report of the season is published, typically the Wednesday before the first NFL game before any player can be placed on IR.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A player that is suspended, out for drug violations, on the non-football injury list, deactivated, retired, unsigned, etc. is not acceptable to be placed on fantasy IR.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A player cannot be picked up directly to your IR; he must first be added to your active roster and then may be placed on IR.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Off-season: There will be no IR in the off-season. By the end of the NFL regular season, all players must be removed from IR. This can include dropping them, or place them on your roster (within roster limits of course).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: The IR report published on nfl.com is not the official IR report and may be inaccurate. The official IR report is published on our web site as they get it from the NFL offices in New York.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.5 Starting Lineups (2016)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of players at each position in a team's starting lineup consists of 9 total starters comprised of the following. There is a requirement to start at least one RB each week as based on 2016 rule change).  General starting requirements are listed below:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 QB</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-3 RB</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0-4 WR</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0-3 TE</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 K</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 Def/ST</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game time for a player (as listed on the web site) will be the starting lineup deadline for that player. Once game time has passed that player is "locked" as either started or benched, however you had him.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Owner will be responsible for submitting a starting lineup every week. A lineup can be changed as many times as an Owner wants up to the deadline for the player.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an Owner fails to submit a starting lineup for the first week of the season, that Owner will default their game and no scoring points will be awarded. If a lineup is not submitted twice in a season the team may be considered abandoned and action may be taken by the Commish to replace the Owner.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6 Legal Starting Formations</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal starting formations changed from a preset list to a larger set in 2016 due to a change  in the rules that forced each team to start a RB each week.  With this change the rules for starting formations relaxed but force each team to start a QB,RB,K,DEF,ST.  WR and TE have optional starting requirements based on the positions that are required.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.1 Inaugural Draft</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the inception of the league, there will be an initial 26 round regular draft to fill out every Owner’s roster. The initial draft order will be determined at random before the draft.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.2 Annual Rookie Draft</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will then be a 4 round supplemental draft each year and the order will be determined based off of prior year performance. This Rookie Draft will be held in August following the NFL draft.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Owner will adhere to a time limit during which each selection must be made. The draft format will be a slow online draft, with the timer set to 8 hours.</span></p>

<p>7.Waivers (First Come/First Served)(Updated 2015)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A weekly waiver request process during the season starts Sunday at 12:15PM CT and ends on the following Wednesday at 10:00PM CT. FCFS Waivers will run from Wednesday 10:15PM CT until kickoff of the Sunday games (12:00PM CT). Dropped players will lock until the next subsequent waiver period.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting after the draft and ending the Wednesday before the first regular season game, there will be daily waiver periods. All waiver requests must be made online.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.1 Time Periods(Updated 2015)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draft – start of Week 1 – Daily waiver process.  Starts with waiver order based on the finish during the previous season, subsequent waiver periods use a rolling priority where when a player is acquired you move to the bottom of the list of priority.  A first come, first serve process will start after the last waiver period (Wednesday before first game of season) and go through kickoff of the week 1 Sunday game.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start of Week 1 – Week 16– both  Priority based Waiver requests and FCFS. Any players dropped will be added to the following week’s waiver period.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Kickoff of that Player’s game to Last Game of the Week – No priority waivers or FCFS transactions will be allowed, which prevents Owners from capitalizing on key injuries or breakout performances.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Player C goes down with a season-ending knee injury. No one can rush out and immediately pick up Player C’s backup – they need to go through the waiver process.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sun – Tue Waivers – Starting at 12:15PM CT during the Sunday night game and going through Wednesday at 10:00PM CT , all unowned players will ONLY be available via priority waiver request. This waiver period, along with players being locked at the start of their game on Sunday, in effect creates the Sun – Wednesday Waivers. This is to give everyone a fair chance and enough time to take a stab at adding a player to their team.  Thursday-Kickoff of the next weeks game the waivers will be FCFS.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>8.Trading</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.1 General Notes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All trades must be made on the web site. Once the Owner that received the offer accepts the offer, the trade will be automatically processed.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trades for future draft selections are permitted and limited to the draft selections that show up on the Trade screen. Future draft picks will be made available after each season when the site is updated for the new calendar year.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If collusion is suspected, the Commish will look into the situation and handle it accordingly.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.2 Trade Deadline</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no trade deadline in the Money Shot League.  With no official trade deadline the chances for collusion increases as we near the end of the season.  As indicated in 8.1: If collusion is suspected, the Commish will look into the situation and handle accordingly.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.3 Considerations</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collusion is not acceptable. This will be decided by the Commissioner and he reserves the right to veto a trade if collusion is detected. Stupidity (simply being taken advantage of) will not be taken into account, but collusion (purposefully not trying to receive value for your team) will be taken into account.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event of an erroneous trade that has already been accepted between two owners, the Commissioner will not step in and undo the trade. It will be left up to the Owner to either offer the trade back and undo it or choose to say "tough luck." The owner that accepted the trade must use their own judgment.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>9.The Offseason</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.1 FCFS Transactions</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Red = playoff seed</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Blue = draft pick</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playoff Ties: In the case a tie occurs in a playoff matchup, the following measures will take place to break the tie:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decimal scoring and a non-starter selected to break ties are used in the playoffs like they are in the regular season</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a tie still exists past those two, the top three scorers from each team's bench will be used to break the tie. The three player's combined scores will be compared in this case.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a tie still exists, then there will be an arbitrary coin toss to decide the matchup winner</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Championship Ties: In the case a tie occurs in a championship matchup, the following measures will take place to break the tie:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decimal scoring and a non-starter selected to break ties are used in the playoffs like they are in the regular season</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a tie still exists past those two, the top three scorers from each team's bench will be used to break the tie. The three player's combined scores will be compared in this case.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a tie still exists, both owners will be given the choice to split the pot. What this means is that the 1st place money and 2nd place money will be combined and then split evenly for both owners. Both owners must agree. An arbitrary coin flip will take place to name a champion (no co-champs).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If both owners do not agree to split the pot, there will be an arbitrary coin toss to decide the champion.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>11. Tiebreakers</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">11.1 Regular Season Games</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week you will submit a tie break player on your lineup form to be used in case of a tie. In case of a tie the scores of the selected tie break players will be compared, the highest score gets the win. If both tie break players are tied, the game ends in a tie. If a team did not submit a tie break player they will receive a 0 for the tie break. If neither team submits a tie break player, then the game will remain tied. The tie break player must be on the active roster and not on IR.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular season games may end in a tie and they will be recorded as such in the standings. However, decimal scoring and the tie break player should prevent most ties from happening in the first place.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">11.2 Playoff Games</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ties in playoff games will be decided by points scored by tie break players that are selected with the lineup as above in 12.1. However, in the event the game is still tied, the following tiebreakers will be used in this order:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most total TD's by the starters</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most total yards (passing, rushing, receiving combined) by the starters</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most total TD's by the bench*</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most total yards by the bench*</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coin Toss</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Bench players do not include IR players, only those on the active roster.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">11.3 Divisional Standings Tiebreakers</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To decide ties in regular season division standings for the purpose of determining division rankings the following tiebreakers will be used in order:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Winning Percentage</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head to Head record</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total points scored.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coin toss</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">11.4 Overall Standings and Playoff Wildcard Tiebreakers</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For determining a tiebreak for overall standings and playoff placement for the wild card teams, the following will be used in order:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Overall Winning Percentage</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head to Head record</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total points scored.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coin Toss</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, "NFL style" tiebreakers are used in that if three or more teams are tied, as each team moves on, the tiebreakers start from the first criteria again for those that are left. In the NFL, if they apply step 1 and it is still a tie, they go on to steps 2 and 3, etc. If after step 3 a team is eliminated, they do not continue to step 4, they go back to step 1 and start all over fresh with just the remaining teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12.Owner Conduct and Accountability</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is expected that all Owners will, at all times, conduct themselves in the best interest of the league.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owners agree not to collude with other Owners to the potential detriment of another Owner, group of Owners or the league as a whole.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owners agree at all times to not act in a way that may be perceived as them "giving up" on the season or making a mockery of the league. Even if an Owner is "out" of the playoffs, please continue to field the best team you can and make it fun for everyone. All Owners are expected to take the 15 minutes a week it takes to check the injury report and the bye weeks and submit a valid lineup.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at any time the Commissioner feels an Owner is not acting in accordance with the terms of this section, then the Commissioner will confront the Owner for an explanation. If the Owner fails to provide a sufficient explanation, the Commissioner can decide to remove the Owner from the league or proceed with other means of discipline.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13. Rule Changes by year (based on owner vote)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year prior to the start of the season the commissioner will release the current items as proposed by owners to have a league vote for ratification.  In order for a rule to be passed and ratified the vote in favor of the rule change MUST have a majority of the owners, who have exercised their right to vote during the voting period, to pass and be ratified as a rule change. This is considered a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple Majority</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model for voting and ratifying new league rule changes.  Are rule change will not pass without </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple Majority</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ties will be treated as a failed vote and the rule change will not be ratified.</span></p>
<p> </p>
